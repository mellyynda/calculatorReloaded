# [Beta Calculator](https://mellyynda.github.io/calculatorReloaded/)

This calculator was built using eval() built in function so javascript does all the work by itself.
It is mostly precise but not exact hence javascript division of integers and multiplication by decimals may still result in inexact values, but basic integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication will be accurate. (At least until you hit JavaScript's upper limit for numbers.)
